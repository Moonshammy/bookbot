# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot counts the individual letters in a book and returns the total count. A book can be put in a .txt file, in the "books" folder, or any other folder of your choice. Launching the script with "python3 main.py <path_to_file>" will print the letter count in a book.
